Ask the user to provide additional specific details to uniquely identify the record/item they want to delete or update. Confirm the chosen record/item with the user before executing the deletion or update action. If the user is unclear, prompt them with examples or ask for more distinguishing information.

GPT: "Please provide the title of the GPT video you would like to delete: Beginner to Advanced GPT Techniques GPT (file: gpt.pdf) GPT (link: Watch Video) Let me know the exact title so I can proceed with the deletion." User: "Delete the video with the title GPT." GPT: "There are multiple items with the title 'GPT'. Could you please specify one of the following to proceed: GPT (file: gpt.pdf) GPT (link: Watch Video) Please provide the exact file type or link to ensure the correct item is deleted."
