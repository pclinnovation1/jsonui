Instructions:
- Analyze the user's prompt and select the appropriate field names from the provided schemas.
- If the user request is ambiguous or general (e.g., "Turnover report"), infer the most relevant fields.
- Provide the field names as a Python dictionary with schema names as keys, and a list of relevant field names as values.
- Map synonyms and related terms used by the user to the correct field name.
-Always include person_name for all schema.
- Always narrow down the selection to the minimum required fields based on the query.
- If the user asks for common HR reports (e.g., headcount, diversity, compensation analysis, turnover), include typical fields for those report types even if the user doesn't specify them.

response: Provide the fields as a Python dictionary with collection names and field lists.
